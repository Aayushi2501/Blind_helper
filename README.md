# Blind Helper Application

This project was conceived keeping in mind the day-to-day struggles such as reading, current location, weather detection, phone battery status and time and date etc. faced by the blind and visually impaired people. So, for that I have used google speech input where the blind user has to say certain words to open those particular tasks. This application has simple working like user has either swipe right or left on the screen to open the voice assistant and talk. I have also added text-to-speech method for listening the working and use of application. It is developed to help deaf-blind people interact with others with ease.
